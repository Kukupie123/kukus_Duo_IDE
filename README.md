# kukus_multi_user_ide

Will only support two users.
One caller and one callee
I want to keep this project fairly simple

As for DataChannels.
Create one Data Channel by default and create other data channels as needed BUT it's better to have them defined, setup, and ready to go for, to use them easily when needed by supplying necessary parameters.
